- Must annotate controller classes with @RestController.
- Must specify class-level API routes with @RequestMapping, e.g. ("/api/v1/user").
- Class methods must use best practice HTTP method annotations, e.g, create = @postMapping("/create"), etc.
- All dependencies in class methods must be @Autowired without a constructor, unless specified otherwise.
- Errors must be handled by the Custom GlobalExceptionHandler class.
